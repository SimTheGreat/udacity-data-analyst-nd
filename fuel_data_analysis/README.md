<h1>fuel_data_analysis</h1>
<h2>my results of analysing fuel_data and the growth of the car industrie</h2>
I worked with:
<ul> <li><strong>python3</strong> 
<li><strong>jupyter notebook</strong> </ul>
and the modules: 
<ul><li><strong>pandas</strong>
 <li><strong> NumPy</strong>
 <li><strong>seaborn</strong>
 <li><strong>matplotlib</strong></ul>

I divided my analysis into 6 parts and creating new CSV files. <br>
In case you want to only see the final product just go to file 'step5 and 6'.<br>
